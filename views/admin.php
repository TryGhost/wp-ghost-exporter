	<p>Hey there! We’re excited to help you migrate WordPress content over to Ghost, and this plugin is designed to help with that process by exporting your WP content into a set of files which Ghost should be able to import cleanly.</p>
	<h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Tags will be migrated, but not categories. If needed, you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcat2tag-importer/" target="_blank">convert your categories to tags</a> before exporting.</li>
		<li>Ghost does not have built-in comments, but it does integrate with <a href="https://ghost.org/integrations/community/" target="_blank">many comment platforms</a> if you want to migrate your comments there.</li>
		<li>No custom fields, meta, shortcodes, post types, taxonomies or binary files will be migrated. Just regular <strong>posts</strong>, <strong>pages</strong>, <strong>tags</strong> and <strong>images</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Steps to follow</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Click the "Download Ghost file" button. You will receive a <code>.json</code> file.</li>
		<li>Log into your Ghost site, and head to the “Labs” section in admin and import the file.</li>
		<li>Verify that everything is working as expected, and make any manual adjustments</li>
	</ol>
